              Tanjiro Kamado (竈門かまど 炭たん治じ郎ろう) is the main
              protagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is a Demon
              Slayer in the Demon Slayer Corps, who joined to find a remedy to
              turn his sister, Nezuko Kamado, back into a human and to hunt down
              and kill demons, and later swore to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji, the
              King of Demons, in order to prevent others from suffering the same
              fate as him.

              Before he became a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro was a coal burner before
              his family was slaughtered by Muzan while his younger sister,
              Nezuko, was turned into a demon.

              Tanjiro is very kind by nature and has been described by others as
              having very gentle eyes and a compassionate persona. He exhibits a
              great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a
              goal to achieve; the best example of this being his relentless
              quest to find a cure for Nezuko. Even though he is relatively
              strong on his own, Tanjiro isn't opposed to asking others for help
              when he needs it. He is very protective of his friends and even
              more so of his younger sister.
